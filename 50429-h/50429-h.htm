<h2 title="Foreword"></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The Editors</span> of this year’s Oxford Poetry,
the work of undergraduates who have been in
residence since the date of the last collection, have
attempted to make the volume more representative
of Poetry and less representative merely of Oxford
than its predecessors. There is always at Oxford a
fashion in verse as much as in dress, and, to judge
from the bulk of contributions submitted, this fashion
has not changed materially since last noted and
recorded in print. Mr Jones-Smith, of Balliol, still
writes musically of brimming chalices, vermilion
lips, chrysoprase, lotuses, arabesques and darkling
spires against glimmering skies; Miss Smith-Jones,
of Somerville, is equally faithful to her scarlet sins,
beloved hearts, little clutching hands, little pattering
feet, rosaries, eternity, roundabouts, and glimmering
spires against darkling skies. Exclusion
of these worn properties has given the fewer writers
than usual represented here, extended elbow room,
and a chance of showing some individual capacity
for better or worse.</p>

<p class="in0">Most of the pieces have already appeared serially in
<cite>The London Mercury</cite>, <cite>The Spectator</cite>, <cite>The Westminster
Gazette</cite>, <cite>The New Statesman</cite>, <cite>The Nation and Athenæum</cite>,
<cite>The Observer</cite>, and the other leading literary
reviews.</p>

<p class="in0">For permission to use copyright poems, our thanks
are due to Messrs Christophers, publishers of Mr
Golding’s ‘Shepherd Singing Ragtime,’ and to
Messrs Sidgwick and Jackson, publishers of Mr
Rickword’s new volume ‘Behind the Eyes.’</p>

<span class="i0">The mower for the inn beside the ford,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While to the coverts leaps the great-eyed hare.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Of thunder joining battle east and west:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Flittering like dead leaves and like wisps of straws,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Oncoming voices in the vortex burred.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The storm came toppling like a wave, and blurred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In grey the trees that like black steeples towered.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun’s last yellow died. Then who but cowered?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down ruddying darkness floods the hideous flash,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With a great hissing rain till terror drooped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In weariness: and then there came a roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten-thousand-fold, he saw not, was no more&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Beats droning round, and light comes in a flood.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">The wainscot shivered, the crocks shattered, and by,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
<span class="i0">His twisted scythe, melted by its fierce foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose Parthian shot struck down the chimney. Slow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Ward lays hand to his old working-friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thanking God Whose mercy did defend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His servant, yet must drop a tear or two<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And think of times when that old scythe was new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stands in silent grief, nor hears the voices<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of many a bird that through the land rejoices,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor sees through the smashed panes the sea-green sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ripens into blue, nor knows the storm is by.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza drop-cap">
<span class="i0x"><span class="smcap1">The vapour</span>, twining and twitching, seems to throw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black, precipitous boulders to and fro<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light as a bandied scoff; and, look, the cliff&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose root claws at the midworld fire with stiff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmolten, adamantine fingers&mdash;fails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lurches. Above, cold and eternal gales<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Run worrying, shredding, eternal sunlight; snatch<br /></span>
<span class="i0 r8">At the heather; puff at the flocks of cotton; scratch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White scars along the bents. If strangers climb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To this plateau that buffets back slow time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They stand awhile impotent, grey with fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feel solidity’s foundation stir.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But even here a cottage free from harms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies havened, hugged and sheltered by the arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a narrow, green recess. A few stunt oaks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Elders, and barren apples beard the rocks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, sleeker than a pool, the lawn beneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burns white and blue, bewildering the heath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a low wood-bench, rifted by years of rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warped at one end, split far along the grain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A meagre man with a waste, weary smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reads to a boy and girl, or plays awhile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some quiet, grown-up game. He suddenly bows<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Flicker or flame, by question or caress,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
<span class="i0">To break the dead, monotonous, featureless<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winter of grief. At last he rises, and,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With empty scrutiny, feet that understand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No path but falter at random, stumbles out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where tigrish winds whirry and havoc and shout.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His back-blown hair, wet, smarting eyes, recall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The conscious pang of life; and he must fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faint on the ground, or whet his courage keen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clench all his being, prise a path between<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The loud, inimical flaws. With even might<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A man may tread, and fate how seeming fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His intimate heart is troubled, and despair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lays present ambush. Many feel the sting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of casual time like bramble-thorns, that bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A not-enduring spasm: in other blood,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No recollection save the venom of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That whistles about their brain and sears their breath.<br /></span>

<h3>SUMMER BATHING</h3>

<div class="poem-container in2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza drop-cap">
<span class="i0x"><span class="smcap1">The ruckling</span> pool, torn grey by Pendry Weir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Became Cocytus to my boy time fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0 r8">Two haw-trees, pulping fat their close, green fruits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned cuttlefish below, wagging no roots<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But narrow tentacles. Old Jacob Fry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tells how he drained this pool one hot July<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When drought had sucked the white stream thick and slow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fish, four-foot deep, shone thirty feet below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaning to drop a stone, the farmboy whews<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bewildered that his confident ear should lose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All thud for grounding. Now he fears to stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And walks by whistling on another day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here, when the black bees blundered in the heat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half-drunk, rifling the fine-flurred meadowsweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stripped and bathed. At first, numb for delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I lost all thought but this&mdash;Come, you must fight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free from the swirl. But when blank eyes grew clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a pit-pattering mouse came fluttered fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now here and there slide snakish eels, now voles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bolt hizzing over the brook to round, black holes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These groping roots perhaps will grip my flesh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I grow tired of screaming: so the mesh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will move, my bones will crackle, I sink down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So to an end.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Or in some cave of brown<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
<span class="i0">Sluttering scum and broad, plump bladder-weeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old fiends may sprawling meditate false deeds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One, ware of prey, slip out lean fingers, pluck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unusual meat through water’s rush and ruck.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet, braving all, to prove wild fancy vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I held my breath and sank. The brook, astrain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fierce to be free, spun snarling overhead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dull roars droned round, cold currents buffeted.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud of this daring shewn&mdash;but doubtful, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of tempting fortune far&mdash;I battled through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the root-held scroll of turf on the sagging bank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And carefully muscled up. The sheep-field drank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wide-spent, white-spilt sun, the wrapping air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swung flame-like past, and, while I ran, the bare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close-nibbled grass pushed hot against my feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The yeanlings rose and rushed with timid bleat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full-tilt at the mothering ewe; fed sleek with clover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three cows, in mild amazement bending over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gap-set palings, rubbed their necks or chewed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in mid-course I staggered, having trod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Firm on a flat and spiny thistle; stayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nursing my foot, half grinning, half dismayed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then lay full length, as light-heel time were not;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale fears, fantastic perils, all forgot.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Accused with leprous finger the long moors.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The drab, damp air so blanketed the town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No doddered oak swung leathern leaf. The chimneys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pushed oddling pillars at the loose-hung sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May, pansy, lilac, dense as the night steam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lowland swamps, fettered the sodden air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, through the haze, along the ragstone houses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blood-lichens dulled to a rotten-apple brown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind close doors pale women drooped and dragged<br /></span>
<span class="i0 r8">In customary toils. They dusted shelves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or changed from chair to chair dull, cotton cushions:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon, vacantly, they bore them back and wiped<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A word would sear the silence of a week.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a sudden, turning a byeway corner, a cripple,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bloodless with age, lumbered along the road.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The motes of dust whirled at his iron-shod crutches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quickly settled. A dog whined. The old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cripple looked round and saw no man, but gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cruel, crackling chuckle, swung a yard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stopped to look about and laugh again.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
<span class="i0">‘That,’ said a girl in a flat voice, ‘is God.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She turned and slid the table-cover straight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her mother could not answer, but she thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘It must be Beggar Joe, gone lately mad.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lumbered along the road and turned a corner.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His tapping faded and the day was death.<br /></span>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
